									<p>Hi, I'm Manjula!
									 A Software Tester and now a Machine Learning Enthusiast.
									 In the past I worked as a Software tester and also hold 
									 experience working onsite for UAT. I eventually had to quit 
									 my software engineering job for personal reasons. 
									 However now since the situation eases me, I now desire to get 
									 back on my track and continue as a techie.
									 I again started my coding journey as a naive student with a 
									 passion to learn AI world - Machine Learning, Sklearn, Deep Learning, 
									 Tensorflow, Keras, Computer vision ect..  
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>My desire is to land in as a Data Scientist or say AI Engineer and 
									 this has been my focus ever since I have known about AI. 
									 I would want to utilize my knowledge and ideas in the field of machine learning. 
									 Some of the projects here are built from the ground up, from planning, exploring, 
									 designing/modeling and deploying all the way to solve real-life problems.</p>

							<p>Bank Query ChatBot</p>
						</header>
						<p>A banking chatbot with FAQ. The user interacts with a chatbot via the flask app UI. Chatbot accepts the customer's/user's bank related queries in raw text. User input is processed with Natural Language Understanding (NLU), pre-processing of text is handled and bot manages to reply the user with an appropriate answers/responses.</p>

							<p>Cancer Prediction System</p>
						</header>
						<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.</p>
						<p>The key challenge against its detection is to classify tumors into malignant(cancerous) or benign(non-cancerous).</p>
